## Surviving and Thriving in Detty December: Why Where You Sleep Matters

There is December, and then there is **Detty December**. In Nigeria, the last month of the year is not just a time on the calendar; it is a full-blown lifestyle — the air changing, traffic increases, and the energy levels go through the roof. From cities like:  

- Lagos  
- Abuja  
- Port Harcourt  

…cities are packed with **IJGB (I Just Got Back)** tourists and locals all looking for one thing: enjoyment.

But amidst all the concerts, weddings, and beach parties, there is one major challenge: finding peace when the party is over. To truly enjoy the chaos of Detty December, you need a solid home base. Here is how the season works and how to navigate it like a pro.

## The Detty December Experience

Detty December is the peak of social life in Nigeria. It is the season when **"I Just Got Back" (IJGB)** folks land with their accents, and the local residents bring out their best outfits. The calendar is packed back-to-back. You might have:  

- A wedding on Saturday morning  
- A beach party in the afternoon  
- A concert that starts at 2 AM on Sunday  

It is a time of high energy, but it can also be exhausting. The traffic in places like Victoria Island or Maitama can test your patience. The crowds are massive. Because the schedule is so tight, your accommodation stops being just a place to sleep; it becomes your headquarters. You need a place where you can:  

- Get ready with your makeup artist  
- Host friends for pre-drinks  
- Simply collapse after dancing until dawn  

If you don't have the right space, the stress of the season can easily overtake the fun.

## The "Morning After" Comfort

Let’s be honest; the best part of Detty December is often the recovery. It is waking up at 11 AM after a long night, walking into your own kitchen to make a quick breakfast, or ordering food and lounging on a proper sofa. Hotels often have strict breakfast times and housekeeping knocking on your door too early.

A short-term apartment gives you the freedom to move at your own pace. You can:  

- Wash your clothes after a beach day  
- Store your drinks in a full-sized fridge  
- Lay out all your shopping  

It offers a level of privacy and ease that allows you to recharge fully before hitting the streets again. This balance between "going hard" and "resting well" is the secret to surviving the season without burning out.

Don't leave your comfort to chance. By choosing a verified, comfortable space on Sojourn, you are guaranteeing that your holiday remains stress-free from start to finish.
