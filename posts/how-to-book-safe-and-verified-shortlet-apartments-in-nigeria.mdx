### Understanding Shortlet Apartments in Nigeria

A shortlet apartment is a fully furnished apartment rented for a short duration—daily, weekly, or monthly. Unlike hotels, shortlets typically offer:

- Full living spaces  
- Private kitchens  
- More privacy  
- Better value for groups and families  
- A home-like experience  

Shortlet apartments in Nigeria are commonly used by:
- Business travelers  
- Couples on weekend trips  
- Families attending events  
- Remote workers  
- Tourists  
- Nigerians relocating temporarily  

Because most shortlets are **privately owned**, **verification** becomes the most important factor when booking.

### Why Shortlet Scams Are Common in Nigeria

Shortlet scams thrive due to structural gaps in the rental ecosystem.

#### 1. Rapid Market Growth Without Regulation
The shortlet industry expanded faster than regulations could follow, creating loopholes scammers exploit.

#### 2. Informal Booking Culture
Many bookings happen through:
- Instagram DMs  
- WhatsApp chats  
- Telegram groups  

These channels provide **zero buyer protection**.

#### 3. Trust-Based Transactions
Scammers rely on urgency, emotion, and verbal promises—not systems, platforms, or contracts.

#### 4. Lack of Central Verification (Historically)
Until recently, there were few platforms verifying both hosts and properties at scale.

### Most Common Shortlet Scams in Nigeria

Understanding scam patterns helps you avoid them.

#### 1. Instagram Shortlet Pages
Luxury apartment photos are posted at very low prices. After payment:
- Messages stop  
- Calls go unanswered  
- The page disappears  

#### 2. Fake Agent Representation
Someone claims to manage multiple apartments but has:
- No official website  
- No office address  
- No booking system  
- No accountability  

Once paid, they vanish.

#### 3. Bait-and-Switch Listings
You book one apartment, but on arrival:
- You’re told it’s “unavailable”  
- A lower-quality alternative is offered  
- You’re pressured to accept  

#### 4. Deposit-Before-Viewing Scam
You’re asked to pay a “refundable deposit” before:
- Seeing the apartment  
- Receiving booking confirmation  
- Verifying ownership  

#### 5. Double Booking Scam
The same apartment is sold to multiple guests for the same dates.

### Critical Red Flags You Should Never Ignore

If you notice any of the following, **do not proceed**:

- Prices far below market rate  
- Pressure to “pay now or lose it”  
- Refusal to share exact location  
- No written booking confirmation  
- Payments requested only to personal accounts  
- No cancellation or refund policy  
- No website or verified platform  
- Poor communication once payment is requested  

Scammers rely on urgency and emotional manipulation.

### Why Booking Shortlets Through Social Media Is Risky

Social media platforms were built for content—not transactions.

#### Risks of Social Media Bookings
- No host verification  
- No dispute resolution  
- Fake reviews and testimonials  
- Accounts can disappear instantly  
- No transaction history  

If anything goes wrong, **you’re on your own**.

A verified shortlet apartment means:
- The apartment physically exists  
- The host has been vetted  
- Photos reflect the real property  
- Amenities are accurately listed  
- The location is confirmed  
- There is accountability  

Verification removes uncertainty and protects travelers.
